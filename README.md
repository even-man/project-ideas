# Project Ideas

Mini Excel
* Console application that builds a simple excel engine that takes a CSV file that has functions, calculated fields, and outputs an excel file with formated values. Idea from [Tsoding](https://youtu.be/HCAgvKQDJng?si=aGEWWWk2Y-Z7rB7B)

Paralell computed Machine Learning Algorithms
* Just an implementation of paralell computated machine learning algorithms on some old machine learning assignments. Want to compare run times.

Virtual DOM
* Based on [this](https://youtu.be/85gJMUEcnkc?si=5fokBuy328hqxqIJ) idea

Data Structures / Algorithms
* Remake some algorithms and data structures and test them on big sets of numbers.
* External Sort

Socket Programming .NET C#
* Create a client/server style socket program.

Console Weather Utility

Information Retrieval
* Read about information retrieval techniques and indexing for search engines. Find some pages to index. Use this algorithm [TF IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)
* Can probably use the text datasets provided by sklearn
